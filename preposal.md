# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to make a visual novel for sure. 
Another idea would maybe but i'm not too sure maybe something like akinator but more limited. 
I might also might want to make something like chess but instead i make the pieces move differently essentially different starting spots, and different movements.
TODO
I'm definitely most interested in visual novels since i've read like 10 of them and they are fun, and interesting.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
None
TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?
I don't have any idea how to use renpy and when i download it. It does not seem to work.
Also the visual novel medium is honestly always tends to get dark. Is that okay for this project not saying I'm going to but that's how visual novels just are a lot of the times.
